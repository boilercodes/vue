# [Vue Template][website] &middot; [![GitHub license]](./LICENSE) ![Test Action] ![Deploy Action]

This is our fully-featured, simple to use template for new Vue projects. Not only it includes everything your need
to get started, from the basics to the most advanced features, but it also keeps everything organized through modern coding
conventions.

By default, this template deploys a static build of the website to GitHub Pages, which you can check out [here][website].
